        <p>It was many and many a year ago,<br>
            In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
            That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
            By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
            And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
            Than to love and be loved by me.<br>
            <br>
            I was a child and she was a child,<br>
            In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
            But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
            I and my Annabel Lee—<br>
            With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
            Coveted her and me.<br>
            <br>
            And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
            In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
            A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
            My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
            So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
            And bore her away from me,<br>
            To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
            In this kingdom by the sea.<br>
            <br>
            The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
            Went envying her and me—<br>
            Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
            In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
            That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
            Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br>
            <br>
            But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
            Of those who were older than we—<br>
            Of many far wiser than we—<br>
            And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
            Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
            Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
            Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
            <br>
            For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
            Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
            And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
            Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
            And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
            Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
            In her sepulchre there by the sea—<br>
            In her tomb by the sounding sea.<br>
